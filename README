========================================================================

 1. Introduction
 ----------------

With phplug, it's easy to develop high performance and high quality applications,
based on the object oriented branch of PHP. The main goal of this project is to
maximize code re-usability and accessibility, as such as minimizing performance
overkills, even (or especially) in large, rich ajax applications.

You have the choice, develop a whole application encapsulated in plugins, or encapsulate
only parts of your application and use them all over your project (e.g. for business rules, etc.)

If you are experienced in Eclipse plugin development, you'll rarely have problems with this framework.

 3. Installation
 ----------------

If you are about to create a new project, the installation is very easy:
	
	1. Go to the root directory of your application
	2. Copy the ch.thobens.phplug.tar.gz into this directory
	3. Unpack the archive
	
Now you have the framework. If you downloaded the Platform only, you will now have just
one plugin in your application that will print the well-known "Hello World!" text. You
can remove this one later, it's just for you to check if the installation was successful.
Otherwise you'll have a bunch of already-installed plugins that you can use as they are.

If you have to integrate phplug in an existing framework, it's a bit more complicated by now:
//TODO
